## Plan on improving the project

-Enhancement of accessibility
Make the site more accessible so everyone—including those with disabilities—may use it.
Check the color variation between the backdrop and the words.
Provide keyboard control so visitors can move about the site using their keyboards.

2. Enhance performance: The page load should load faster and operate better.
   Reduce the size of your CSS file to speed up its load.
   Incorporate responsive pictures with the srcset attribute for varying picture sizes.
   The ticket form should have form validation so that users may receive comments immediately.
   Give the links connecting to other pages seamless movement.
   To use it simply, include a "back to top" button.
   The intention is to provide consumers with more practical stuff.
   Create a blog section where you discuss coffee, methods of making it, and coffee culture.
   Including quotes from satisfied consumers will help to increase credibility and confidence.
   Create a gallery space highlighting the atmosphere and offerings of the coffee business.
   Incorporate more products on the menu with careful descriptions and images.
3. Improve search engine optimization.
   Increase the page's visibility on search engines as an aim.
   Use sensible HTML words: section>, nav>, footer>, and article>.
   Add meta tags in the HTML head, including author, keyword, and description.
   Use logical link messages and URLs.
4. Incorporate a back end for bookings.
   One wants to include a backend capable of managing reservation form inputs.

   Provide a means for individuals to score their experience.
   Track users of your website and evaluate its performance with Google tracking tools.
7. Verify it for several browsers.
